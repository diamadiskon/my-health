# Elder Health Monitoring Dashboard

A comprehensive Proof of Concept (POC) application for elder care and health monitoring, designed to bridge the gap between elderly patients and their healthcare providers/family caregivers through technology.

## What This POC Demonstrates

This application showcases a modern approach to elder care management with dual user roles:
- **Patient Interface**: Elderly individuals can manage their health profiles and view their data
- **Admin/Caregiver Interface**: Healthcare providers or family members can monitor and manage multiple patients

## Core Features

### üè• Patient Management System
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure account creation for both patients and admins
- **Role-based Access Control**: Separate dashboards for patients and healthcare providers
- **Patient Profiles**: Comprehensive medical information storage including:
  - Personal details (name, age, gender, blood type)
  - Emergency contact information
  - Medical history and current medications
  - Known allergies and medical conditions

### üìä Real-time Health Monitoring
- **Interactive Health Metrics Dashboard**: Visualize health data through responsive charts
- **Multi-metric Tracking**:
  - Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) with trend analysis
  - Heart rate monitoring with irregular rhythm detection
  - Weight tracking over time
  - Oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels
  - Daily step count and activity monitoring
  - Sleep pattern analysis (light, deep, REM sleep phases)
- **Live Data Refresh**: Real-time updates of health metrics
- **Fall Detection Alerts**: Safety monitoring capabilities

### üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Caregiver Dashboard
- **Household Management**: Admins can manage multiple patients in their care
- **Patient Invitation System**: Secure invitation-based patient onboarding
- **Comprehensive Patient Views**: Access detailed health information and trends
- **Multi-patient Oversight**: Monitor multiple elderly patients from a single interface

### üí° Smart Health Insights
- **Trend Visualization**: Interactive charts showing health metric changes over time
- **Tabbed Interface**: Organized view of different health metrics
- **Current vs Historical Data**: Compare latest readings with historical trends
- **Health Status Indicators**: Visual cues for health metric ranges

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for modern, accessible user interface
- **Recharts** for interactive health data visualization
- **React Router** for seamless navigation
- **Axios** for API communication

### Backend
- **Go (Golang)** with Gin web framework for high-performance API
- **PostgreSQL** database for reliable data storage
- **JWT Authentication** for secure user sessions
- **RESTful API** design for scalable communication

### Infrastructure
- **Docker Compose** for containerized development environment
- **Multi-container Architecture** with separate frontend, backend, and database services

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Node.js and Yarn (for local frontend development)
- Go 1.19+ (for local backend development)

### Quick Start with Docker
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd my-health

# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend API: http://localhost:8080
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Frontend development
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

# Backend development
cd backend
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

## User Workflows

### For Patients (Elderly Users)
1. **Registration**: Create account or receive invitation from caregiver
2. **Profile Setup**: Complete medical information and emergency contacts
3. **Health Monitoring**: View personal health trends and current metrics
4. **ID Sharing**: Share patient ID with caregivers for household inclusion

### For Admins/Caregivers
1. **Dashboard Access**: Monitor all patients in household
2. **Patient Invitation**: Send invitations to new patients using their ID
3. **Health Oversight**: Review detailed health metrics and trends for each patient
4. **Profile Management**: Update and maintain patient information
