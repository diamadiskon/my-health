## 📋 Implementation Guidelines for AI Agents

### General Development Standards

**Code Quality Requirements:**
- 90%+ test coverage for all new features
- TypeScript strict mode for frontend development
- Go best practices with proper error handling
- Comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Security-first development (OWASP Top 10 compliance)

**Performance Requirements:**
- API response times <500ms for standard operations
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Frontend bundle size optimized (<1MB gzipped)
- Mobile app performance 60fps with <3s startup time

**Security Requirements:**
- HTTPS/TLS 1.3 for all communications
- JWT token expiration and refresh mechanism
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS and CSRF protection

### Database Migration Strategy

**For each new feature requiring database changes:**
1. Create migration files in `/backend/migrations/`
2. Include both up and down migrations
3. Test migrations on development data
4. Document schema changes in API documentation
5. Plan for zero-downtime deployments

### Testing Strategy

**Required test coverage:**
- Unit tests: Business logic, utilities, models
- Integration tests: API endpoints, database operations
- E2E tests: Critical user workflows
- Performance tests: Load testing for new features
- Security tests: Vulnerability scanning

### Deployment Considerations

**CI/CD Pipeline Updates:**
- Automated testing for all new features
- Staging environment deployment and validation
- Blue-green deployment for zero downtime
- Automated rollback capabilities
- Performance monitoring and alerting

**Infrastructure Scaling:**
- Container resource requirements assessment
- Database performance impact analysis
- CDN and caching strategy updates
- Monitoring and observability enhancement
